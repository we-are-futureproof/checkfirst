Give ScheduleAI a callback URL and it will **push** events to you in real-time.
Use them to automate downstream workflows—post a message in Slack when a report is filed, open a ticket in your QMS when an issue is raised, or update your planning board as soon as a counter-signature lands.

#### Supported events

| Event `type`                | Fired when…                                         | Typical use-case                                                 |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `STATUS_CHANGED`            | ScheduleAI data model status changed. | Capture change details and act accordingly in your systems.      |


#### Status Change Codes

When the `STATUS_CHANGED` event is fired, event `data` will include one of the following:

- Open
- Allocated inspector
- Draft date
- Planned date
- Accepted by inspector
- Proposed to client
- Confirmed by client
- Completed
- Cancelled


#### Registering a webhook

##### Option 1 – Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Organisation ▸ Webhooks**.
2. Click **Add Webhook**.
3. Pick an event `type`.
4. Enter the public **POST** URL your server will listen on.

That’s it -- events start flowing immediately.

##### Option 2 – REST API

```bash
curl -X POST https://schedule.checkfirst.ai/api/v1/hooks \
  -H "X-API-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "url": "https://example.com/webhooks/checkfirst",
        "type": "STATUS_CHANGED"
      }'
```

<details>
<summary>Successful response</summary>

```json
{
  "id": 9,
  "type": "STATUS_CHANGED",
  "url": "https://example.com/webhooks/checkfirst",
  "client": { "id": 2 }
}
```

</details>

> **Note**
> The callback URL **must accept POST** requests.

#### Event payload format

Each delivery is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": 1042,
  "type": "STATUS_CHANGED",
  "createdAt": "2024-06-05T09:27:14Z",
  "data": {
    "issueId": "8e2a60e1-92e7-4827-97d5-672b8b5ef4d3",
    "projectReference": "PR-23015",
    "competencyCode": "ISO17020",
    "inspector": "K. Nguyen"
  }
}
```

| Field       | Description                               |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `id`        | Unique delivery identifier.               |
| `type`      | Event type (see table above).             |
| `createdAt` | UTC timestamp when the event was emitted. |
| `data`      | Event-specific attributes                 |

> **Delivery guarantees**
> Events are **at-least-once**: duplicate IDs are possible—deduplicate on `id`.

#### Handling retries

If your endpoint returns **anything other than** `2xx`, ScheduleAI retries with exponential back-off (up to three attempts).
Always respond quickly (e.g. `202 Accepted`) and do heavy processing asynchronously.

#### Securing your webhook

1. **HTTPS only** – use a valid TLS certificate.
2. **IP allow-listing** (optional) – Permit traffic from ScheduleAI’s egress IPs.
3. **HMAC signature** (recommended) – add a shared secret header such as `X-Signature` and verify the request body.

#### Testing locally

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

Point the dashboard at the forwarding URL (e.g. `https://random.ngrok.io/webhooks/checkfirst`) and watch events stream into your dev machine.

#### Managing existing hooks

| Action      | Endpoint                    | Example                                                             |
| :---------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| List hooks  | `GET /api/v1/hooks`         | `curl -H "X-API-Key:…" https://schedule.checkfirst.ai/api/v1/hooks` |
| Delete hook | `DELETE /api/v1/hooks/{id}` | `curl -X DELETE …/hooks/9`                                          |


## Inspector Sync
