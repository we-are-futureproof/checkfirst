# Hello, ScheduleAI -- in 30 minutes  ⏱️

Follow the six steps below and you’ll have data imported, an AI‑generated plan, a downloadable report, and real‑time webhooks wired into your app.

1. Create an API key
2. Import people & projects
3. Run the scheduler
4. Review & download reports
5. Set up real‑time webhooks (optional but recommended)



### Prerequisites

* A free **Checkfirst** account – [sign up](https://dashboard.checkfirst.ai) if you haven’t already.
* Organisation **Owner** or **Developer** role (needed to create API keys).
* `curl` or a similar HTTP client.

> **Base URL** for all calls shown here: `https://schedule.checkfirst.ai/api/v1/`


### 1. Create an API key

1. Sign in to the dashboard.
2. Open **Organisation → Developer**.
3. Click **Generate API Key** and give it a name (e.g. `quickstart-demo`).
4. Copy the key value – you’ll only see it once.

```bash
# store your key in an environment variable for convenience
export SAI_KEY="sk_live_123..."
```


### 2. Import people & projects

Download the CSV templates from the dashboard (or craft your own) and upload them via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST "${BASE}/people/import" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $SAI_KEY" \
  -F file=@people.csv

curl -X POST "${BASE}/projects/import" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $SAI_KEY" \
  -F file=@projects.csv
```

*Accepted columns and examples are listed in* **Import & Export**.


### 3. Run the scheduler

```bash
curl -X POST "${BASE}/schedules" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $SAI_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "window": {"from": "2025-06-01", "to": "2025-06-30"},
    "objective": "min_travel"      // other options: max_utilisation, balanced
  }'
```

The response contains a `scheduleId`. Most schedules are ready in seconds; for larger datasets you can poll `GET /schedules/{id}` until `status` becomes `COMPLETED`.


### 4. Review & download reports

Utilisation, Travel, Compliance and other reports are available as soon as the schedule is complete.

```bash
curl -L "${BASE}/reports/utilisation?month=2025-06" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $SAI_KEY" -o utilisation_june.xlsx
```

Open the file locally or push it into your BI pipeline.


### 5. Set up real‑time webhooks (optional but recommended)

Automatically react when users submit reports or when issues are created:

```bash
curl -X POST "${BASE}/hooks" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $SAI_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "REPORT_CREATED",
    "url" : "https://example.com/schedule/hooks"
  }'
```

Your endpoint will now receive a JSON payload every time a new report is submitted.


**Done!** You’ve imported data, generated a schedule, exported metrics and wired up automation – all within half an hour.
