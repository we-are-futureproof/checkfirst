# ScheduleAI

Smarter scheduling, simplified

With ScheduleAI you spend less time scheduling, more time executing


Make complex inspection and certification scheduling effortless. ScheduleAI condenses weeks of manual planning into minutes using AI‑powered optimisation that balances skills, locations, competencies and real‑world constraints.

## Why ScheduleAI?

* **Slash planning time** – cut multi‑week rota creation down to a single click.
* **Reduce cost & travel** – algorithmically minimise travel miles and idle hours.
* **Stay compliant** – ensure every job meets competency, audit and regional rules.
* **React instantly** – auto‑reschedule when work orders change or resources become unavailable.

## Who is it for?

ScheduleAI is built for inspection & certification teams operating in highly‑regulated TICC sectors such as agriculture, mining, insurance, construction and energy. If you manage dozens of inspectors, auditors or engineers across multiple locations, ScheduleAI keeps your operation on time and on budget.

## How it works (at a glance)

| Step            | What happens                                                                 |
|:------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Import**   | Upload people, projects and constraints via CSV or API.                      |
| **Optimise** | The AI scheduler generates an optimal allocation plan for the chosen window. |
| **Review**   | Visualise utilisation, travel and compliance in the dashboard.               |
| **Export**   | Download reports or push data into your systems via API & webhooks.          |

## Core capabilities

### One‑click AI scheduling

Run the optimiser for any date range. The engine evaluates skills, competencies, travel time, work‑hour limits and priority rules to output the best‑fit schedule.

### Dynamic rescheduling

Plans rarely survive first contact with reality. ScheduleAI continuously adapts – drag‑and‑drop changes in the UI or post new jobs via API and get an updated plan in seconds.

### API‑first integration

Every action available in the dashboard is exposed via REST. Create jobs, trigger optimisations, fetch utilisation stats and subscribe to real‑time webhooks.

### Rich reporting

Out‑of‑the‑box exports for Utilisation, Travel, Compliance, Demand and more. Pipe CSV/XLSX or SQL dumps straight into your BI warehouse.

## Proven impact

* **5× faster** schedule creation for a multinational inspection provider.
* **28 % reduction** in travel costs after dynamic routing optimisation.
* **100 % audit readiness** thanks to automatic competency checks.
